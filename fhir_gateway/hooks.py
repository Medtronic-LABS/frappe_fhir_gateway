# The dock, the rail down the left of the desk, is a document rather than a hook. Author it in
# Manage Dock on a developer-mode site and press Export to App, and it is written to
# `fhir_gateway/dock/fhir_gateway/fhir_gateway.json` for git to carry. An app that ships none has no
# rail: its sidebar gets a switcher in the header instead.
#
# A companion app, one that extends a host app rather than standing on its own, says so with
# `mount_on` on that same record, and its entries are appended to the host's rail. Mounting keeps
# the companion off the apps screen, so it takes precedence over any add_to_apps_screen above.

# FHIR REST API
# ------------------
# Owns the /fhir/* path space with a custom page renderer -- website_route_rules only rewrites to
# Frappe's own HTML page renderers (DocumentPage/WebFormPage/etc, see website/path_resolver.py),
# none of which return raw JSON, and /api/* requests never reach the website router at all
# (frappe/app.py dispatches them separately before get_response() runs). page_renderer is the
# real, intended extensibility point for an app that wants to own an arbitrary path and return a
# raw werkzeug Response -- see renderer.py.

# Fixtures
# ------------------
# "FHIR Integration" role + its read-only Custom DocPerm grants on exactly the three doctypes this
# gateway exposes (Patient, Patient Encounter, Observation) -- nothing else is reachable through
# this role even if a client asks for it. Filtered (not bare doctype names): Role and Custom DocPerm
# both have hundreds of unrelated site-wide records, so a bare name would make `bench
# export-fixtures` dump every role/permission on the site into this app.
