"""`healthcare` `Vital Signs` -> FHIR `Observation` (category `vital-signs`).

One Vital Signs row holds several distinct measurements (temperature, pulse, respiratory rate,
blood pressure, height, weight, BMI) in one record -- FHIR models exactly this as a single
"vital signs panel" Observation with one `component` per measurement (LOINC 85353-1), rather than
one Observation per reading. `observation.py` is the public resourceType surface; this module only
builds the resource for a Vital Signs source row.

#
# `temperature`'s unit is a real gap, not an assumption glossed over: Vital Signs.temperature is a
# plain Data field with no unit metadata anywhere in healthcare's own schema or settings (checked
# both) -- whatever a user types is unitless as far as the doctype is concerned. This site's own
# demo data is unambiguously Fahrenheit (e.g. "98.4"), so that's what's declared below, but this is
# a per-deployment assumption, not a fact this gateway can verify from the data model itself. A
# Celsius-convention Healthcare install would need this overridden.
